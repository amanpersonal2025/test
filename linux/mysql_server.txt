#Installation:
sudo apt update
# Update package list
sudo apt install mysql-server
#Verify Installation and Check Status:
sudo systemctl status mysql

#This command shows the status of the MySQL service.  It should be active (running).  If it's not, you can start it with:
sudo systemctl start mysql

#And enable it to start on boot:
sudo systemctl enable mysql

#Secure the MySQL Installation (Important):
sudo mysql_secure_installation
#Log in to MySQL:
sudo mysql -u root -p
#Create a New User (Recommended):
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';  # Replace with a strong password
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';  # Grant all privileges (adjust as needed)
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  # Apply the changes

# Replace 'newuser' with the desired username.
# Replace 'newpassword' with a strong password.
#GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES gives the user full access. You can restrict privileges if needed (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on specific databases).
#FLUSH PRIVILEGES is essential; it tells MySQL to reload the grant tables.
# Create a Database:
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase; # Replace with your database name
# Test the Connection (using the new user):
#Exit the MySQL root session:
exit;
#Now, try logging in with the new user:
mysql -u newuser -p
#You should be able to log in using the password you set for the new user.
#Test Database Access:
#Once logged in as the new user, try accessing the database you created:
USE mydatabase;

#This selects the mydatabase database.  You can then create tables and perform other operations within it.  For example:
CREATE TABLE mytable (id INT, name VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO mytable (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Test');
SELECT * FROM mytable;
